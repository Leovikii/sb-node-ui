![Version 3.1.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-3.1.0-e64980)

Sing-Sub is a self-hosted control plane for editing and distributing [sing-box](https://sing-box.sagernet.org/) configurations.

## Features

- Edit profiles, node sets, templates, adapters, and rule sets in a responsive bilingual WebUI.
- Build profiles dynamically from one template, an optional replacement adapter, and filtered nodes.
- Store the workspace, immutable revisions, and SRS artifacts in a private Cloudflare R2 bucket.
- Distribute private configuration subscriptions with compact signed tokens and public rule sets as JSON or SRS.
- Optionally import, back up, and explicitly synchronize data with a private GitHub repository.
- Optionally provision a repository-scoped GitHub Actions workflow to compile SRS artifacts.

## Technology

- WebUI: React 19, Mantine 9, CodeMirror 6, TypeScript, and Vite.
- Runtime and storage: Cloudflare Workers and private Cloudflare R2.
- Optional integrations: private GitHub repository sync and GitHub Actions SRS compilation.

## Deployment

The recommended deployment uses a GitHub fork and Cloudflare Workers Builds:

1. Enable Workers and R2 in Cloudflare, then fork this repository.
2. Connect the fork under the Worker's `Settings > Builds` and track `main`.
3. Set the build command to `npm run build` and the deploy command to `npm run deploy:cloudflare`.
4. Add the encrypted build secret `SING_SUB_ADMIN_PASSWORD` with at least 12 UTF-8 bytes.
5. Deploy, open the generated Worker URL, and sign in with that password.

The initializer creates or reuses `sing-sub-data`, generates missing runtime signing secrets, and creates an empty workspace with the Momo adapter on first login. GitHub data sync, PAT, and SRS compilation are optional after deployment.
