# Sing Sub

Edge-based multi-environment configuration distribution console for [sing-box](https://sing-box.sagernet.org/). Manage sing-box profiles through a web UI, store configurations in a private GitHub repo, and distribute subscription links via Cloudflare Workers.

## Features

- **Cookie-based auth** — Login with GitHub repo + PAT. Session stored as HttpOnly Secure cookie, no third-party auth required.
- **Server-side security** — GitHub PAT stored in Cloudflare KV (encrypted at rest), never exposed to the browser. Same repo from different devices shares one user entry.
- **Edge config building** — Worker fetches templates and nodes from GitHub, merges them on the fly, and caches in KV. No GitHub Actions or Gist needed.
- **Subscription distribution** — `/sub/{token}/{name}.json` with User-Agent filtering (sing-box clients only).
- **Multi-profile** — Manage multiple environments (e.g. `home`, `office`, `travel`) with independent inbound/outbound rules and templates.
- **Preview** — Preview cached configs directly from KV, showing exactly what sing-box clients will receive.
- **Auto-deploy** — Push to `main` triggers GitHub Actions to deploy the Worker automatically.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Vue 3 (Composition API) + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS v4
- **Backend**: Cloudflare Workers + KV
- **Auth**: Cookie-based sessions (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite=Strict)
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions (deploy only)

## Prerequisites

1. A **private GitHub repo** with your sing-box data:

   ```
   your-private-repo/
   ├── sing-sub/
   │   └── rules.json          # Managed by this UI (auto-created on first save)
   ├── outbounds.json           # Outbound node definitions
   └── inbounds.json            # Inbound node definitions (optional)
   ```

   Templates can be hosted anywhere as public URLs (e.g. raw GitHub links).

2. A **GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT)** with `repo` permission (read/write private repos).

   Create one at: https://github.com/settings/tokens

3. A **Cloudflare account** with a custom domain.

## Deployment

### 1. Create KV Namespace

- Cloudflare Dashboard → Storage & Databases → KV → Create a namespace
- Copy the Namespace ID and update `wrangler.toml`

### 2. Set GitHub Secrets

- Go to your repo → Settings → Secrets → Actions
- Add `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` (use the "Edit Cloudflare Workers" template)

### 3. Push to Deploy

```bash
git push origin main
```

## Usage

1. Open your domain → Login with `owner/repo`, GitHub PAT, and a custom subscription token
2. Add/edit profiles — each profile specifies a template URL, node file paths, and filtering rules
3. Save → commits `sing-sub/rules.json` to GitHub and builds all configs on the edge
4. Refresh → force rebuilds all configs from latest remote templates and node files
5. Preview → view the exact cached config that sing-box clients will receive
6. Copy the subscription link → paste into sing-box client

Subscription URL format: `https://your-domain/sub/{token}/{profile_name}.json`

## Security

- PAT is only stored once in KV, keyed by `owner/repo`. No duplication across sessions.
- Session cookies are HttpOnly + Secure + SameSite=Strict (30-day expiry).
- CSP headers restrict scripts and connections to same-origin + GitHub API.
- Login page includes a disclaimer and link to source code, encouraging self-deployment.
